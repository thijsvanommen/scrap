Scrap, the Ten-Day Roguelike

by Thijs van Ommen


Scrap is a roguelike game that was written during a period of ten days. Like
many other roguelikes, it uses a simple ASCII display to show a map of the
world where the game takes place. You, the player, control a robot, which is
represented by '@'. Unfortunately, the world is populated by hostile enemy
robots, which will try to destroy your robot. These enemies are represented
by various characters.

For a short overview of the keyboard controls, push '?' during the game.

Each robot consists of a number of systems, like power cells, sensors and
propulsion. When a robot is hit by weapon fire, its systems are damaged. If a
system's status drops to 50%, it won't be able to function until it has been
repaired. If the status drops to 0%, the system is damaged beyond repair.

Watch out! If your power cell is destroyed, it will explode, causing you to
lose the game. The same goes for your opponents: if you manage to destroy
their power source, they will turn into wrecks. You can then salvage any
remaining systems from that wreck, to plug them into your own robot, making
your stronger.

I hope you'll enjoy the game!
